# DRF-ecom

- Creating an e-commerce website from scratch can be a daunting task. However, using Django Rest Framework (DRF) and React, we can build a full-stack e-commerce site quickly and efficiently.

- We will be using DRF to build the backend of our application. DRF provides robust tools to build APIs quickly and easily, including authentication, serialization, and powerful request handling. Using DRF will make it easier for us to build a scalable and reliable e-commerce site.

- On the frontend, we will use React to build a responsive user interface. React is an efficient and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is well-suited for building complex applications with high interactivity.

- We will use CoreAPI for documentation and schema management. CoreAPI is a powerful tool that provides automatic API documentation, interactive API exploration, and schema management. Using CoreAPI will make it easier for our team to work together and communicate effectively.

- For authentication, we will use JWT tokens. JWT tokens provide a secure and efficient way to authenticate users. They are easy to use and can be integrated seamlessly into our application.

- Finally, the backend will provide comprehensive documentation to the frontend team, including different authentication options to test the API. This will make it easier for our team to work together and ensure that the API is functioning correctly.

## By using these tools and techniques, we can build a robust and scalable e-commerce site quickly and efficiently.
